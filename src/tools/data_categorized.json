'Learning' is often cited as one reason to organize or participate in Hackathons. However, we also know that it is necessary to plan for learning to ensure learning takes place. This Praxisproject is set to run in conjunction with 1-2 hackathons in December/January. In the project, we will continue the work done in last year's iteration of the project on Python-based challenges for the hackathon participants framed in the style of an Arcade Game machine. There the participants built a virtual arcade machine with games in different development phases for the hackathon participants to work on. This way we can have built-in challenges of different difficulty. This includes: \u2022 a frame for the application: a virtual arcade machine \u2022 different games in different development phases (for example Snake, Pong, Pinball) In the hackathon event(s), we will mentor participants and we will use the event(s) to get feedback on our challenges to (potentially) improve them after. Beyond that, we can also use the event for further research.",

The development of personalized and collaborative learning and the achievement of higher-order thinking skills - the so-called 21st century competencies - is still nowadays a significant challenge. At the same time, it is of great interest to understand how learners work, how educators orchestrate their classrooms, and what information they have access to in order to adapt/enhance/improve their orchestration. Emerging technologies have the potential to propel the change from an instructional teaching paradigm, that favors mass instruction, to a learner-centered paradigm, that promotes the development of new roles for both the teacher and the learner. However, their acceptability and adoption are still slow mainly due to fragmented approaches. Importantly, in order to ensure quality education it is mandatory to address unexpected emergencies and disruptive events that may undermine the human and social dimensions of learning. augMENTOR adopts an augmented intelligence approach, where people and machines work together, building on their own strengths, to develop customized and collaborative learning paths that promote both basic and 21st century competencies as well as design thinking and creativity. augMENTOR will leverage advancements in the fields of Pedagogical Design, Creative Pedagogy, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, and Knowledge Representation and Reasoning for instructional purposes.",

This may explain why popular interactive programming environments like Jupyter Notebooks have not caught up with teaching introductory programming in HE (Al-Gahmi et al., 2022) despite their popularity and envisioned potential (Ram\u00edrez-Echeverry et al., 2022). Additionally, systems used for code-writing \u2013 including Jupyter Notebooks \u2013 do not provide instructional support such as worked examples, or supplementary materials that could help students interpret and work with compiler error messages, and understand what a program does or why it does not do what was intended. However, studies in our classes show that such materials and clear communication of expected learning outcomes have a positive effect on the achieved outcomes (Mauritz et al., 2022). This project aims to answer two research questions as a first step to address this challenge: \u2022 RQ1: What is the optimal prompting condition in order to have an LLM generate hints that best help students understand and learn from compiler errors? \u2022 RQ2: How can we help students with exhibiting prompting behavior that leads to optimal tailored feedback/support from the LLM model?",

According to their accounts, the pandemic helped Internet users improve their skills in communicating with others by using video conference software and reflecting critically upon information they found online. These improved digital skills exacerbated not only positive (e.g., feeling informed and safe) but also negative (e.g., feeling lonely) effects of digital media use during the pandemic.

A 2x2 factorial experimental design was used to investigate the impact of the intensity of motor activity and the sensitivity of tactile perception on learning performance, measured as memory recall. Mental effort and perceived workload were monitored as the mediating variables. Participants (N=20) completed a handwriting task, that is, copying text displayed on a prompter using a tablet and a stylus. During the task, the participants used additional pressure to increase the intensity of the motor activity and/or wore gloves to reduce the sensitivity of tactile perception. Results indicate no significant effect of either manipulation on recall, mental effort, or perceived workload. This may suggest that integrating supplementary haptic feedback technologies in MILEs does not impose additional cognitive load or obstruct learning. The findings contribute to the design of MILEs by informing the effective integration of wearable sensors to support authentic practice for skill acquisition. The study can inform future research that explores the effects of haptic senses and their broader applications in other learning contexts, contributing to a deeper understanding of embodied learning and dual-coding theory.",

To that end, we compiled a collection of Python tasks for novices. In particular, a) we identified errors occurring during introductory programming and mapped them to learning tasks; b) we conducted a survey to validate our mapping; c) we conducted semi-structured interviews with instructors to understand potential reasons for such errors and best practices for addressing them. Synthesizing our findings, we discuss the creation of a tasks' corpus to serve as a basis for adaptive tutors.

Related research suggests that existing instruments for assessing digitalization aspects are limited to self-assessment, and there is a need for data-informed frameworks that will allow automated assessments based on data that Higher Education Institutions already collect. To bridge this gap, we propose a conceptual, data-informed framework for assessing Digital Readiness in Higher Education Institutions. We followed a participatory approach informed by related theory and practice to design, together with stakeholders from three academic institutions in three European countries, a Digital Readiness assessment framework on seven dimensions accompanied by 72 data-informed indicators. Digitalization of Higher Education is a priority in political agendas, and educational institutions have acknowledged it as an opportunity to promote digitalization of teaching and learning, organizational structures, and technical services, enabling innovation and internationalization. We envision that this work contributes towards supporting educational institutions in self-reflecting upon their digitalization policies and practices.",

However, little is known about the CA state of the art in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), where dropout is a worldwide problem. Through a systematic literature review, this study summarizes 59 manuscripts about CA published until April 2024. The aim of this review is to identify: 1) WHERE CA was used; 2) WHO were the CA target stakeholders; 3) WHY CA was proposed; 4) WHAT types of data and what types of data gathering and analysis methods are employed; 5) HOW CA was designed, implemented and evaluated and what the stakeholders' role was; and 6) WHICH limitations and constraints affect CA and WHICH recommended practices could contribute to the CA success. Results from our review reveal a considerable number of CA solutions available. However, there is a need for more evidence on how CA solutions inform decision-making among various stakeholders. Thus, more longitudinal studies are needed, involving stakeholders not only in the design but also in the implementation and evaluation of CA solutions. At the same time, findings suggest that including multiple data sources can enrich the analysis and enable triangulation. Additionally, the lack of evidence on the role of CA in dropouts and decision-making in higher education institutions requires more future research on this aspect. Finally, researchers, practitioners, and decision-makers can use the findings obtained in this review to inform future research and practices on how to leverage CA to improve student learning, enhance the learning experience, and reduce student dropouts.",

Key interest is the identification of global trends with a special focus on unbalanced disparities. Strictly following the standardised protocol and the underlying PRISMA approach, 324 records were identified and selected according to the pre-defined protocol for the systematic review. Finally, 62 articles were included in the quantitative and qualitative analysis in response to four research questions: Which (i) journals, (ii) disciplines, and (iii) regions are leading scientific debates and sustainable developments in education and trustworthy/ethical AI, and (iv) what are the past trends? The articles revealed an unbalanced distribution across the various dimensions, together with an exponential growth over recent years. Building upon our analysis, we argue for an increase in interdisciplinary research that shifts the focus from the currently dominant technological focus towards a more human-centered (educational and societal) focus.

In particular, we aimed to explore how hackathon-like events are utilized to promote learning, what systematic approaches are used to orchestrate learning in such events, and to what extent knowledge is systematized and standardized in this context. To that end, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review following established guidelines. In this review we studied 39 research papers published over a 10-year span. Our findings indicate that no standardized setup for hackathons to promote learning and to assess learning outcomes has been investigated exhaustively. We did not find a systematic approach to reliably produce or measure learning effects in hackathons. Most of the reviewed papers relied on perceived learning for the assessment of learning. Based on the consulted literature, this does not provide comprehensive proof of positive learning outcomes from hackathons. We, therefore, conclude that additional research is needed to gather insights and consequently work toward solidifying the role of hackathons as learning tools.

Then, we analyzed students' help-seeking behavior and their performance after receiving scaffolding to investigate if and under which circumstances our assessment may act as a proxy of the ZPD. Results suggest that the computational model may offer an acceptable approximation of the student's ZPD. However, several factors, such as the difficulty of the learning task, the student's age, and their attitude regarding hints, may affect modeling students' cognitive states.

We aimed at covering all educational levels and retrieving important data regarding the planning and execution of research studies and the robustness of results. In total, we reviewed 181 papers and answered three research questions, relating to the educational context of AI use, the methodology and study design utilized in AIED research, and the type of AI algorithms and technologies used in education. Our findings suggest that research in AIED primarily focuses on formal, higher education and that there is a demand for robust and rigorous scientific evidence of the effectiveness and impact of AIED. Furthermore, the findings indicate that the most popular AI technologies currently studied are traditional AI algorithms, usually used for prediction, classification, or clustering. Based on our analysis, we discuss practical implications that can serve as inspiration and guidance for future research initiatives.",

        "title": "Role of Multimodal Learning Systems in Technology-Enhanced Learning (TEL): A Scoping Review",
        "description": "Technology-enhanced learning systems, specifically multimodal learning technologies, use sensors to collect data from multiple modalities to provide personalized learning support beyond traditional learning settings. However, many studies surrounding such multimodal learning systems mostly focus on technical aspects concerning data collection and exploitation and therefore overlook theoretical and instructional design aspects such as feedback design in multimodal settings. This paper explores multimodal learning systems as a critical part of technology-enhanced learning used for capturing and analyzing the learning process to exploit the collected multimodal data to generate feedback in multimodal settings. By investigating various studies, we aim to reveal the roles of multimodality in technology-enhanced learning across various learning domains. Our scoping review outlines the conceptual landscape of multimodal learning systems, identifies potential gaps, and provides new perspectives on adaptive multimodal system design: intertwining learning data for meaningful insights into learning, designing effective feedback, and implementing them in diverse learning domains.",

        "title": "HoloLearn: Towards a Hologram Mediated Hybrid Education",
        "description": "Educational institutions worldwide were thrust into adopting an online educational models due to the COVID-19 pandemic exposing severe limitations of tools used in online education, much to chagrin of both teachers and students. However, despite these limitations, hybrid educational models garnered significant interest. Holograms have shown potential in addressing several of the limitations of online educational tools that are currently in use. This paper reports the findings of an exploratory pilot study which investigates the benefits and limitations of holograms in hybrid and online educational models. The study compares student's holographic viewing experience of the teacher in several dimensions such as presence, zoom exhaustion, and fatigue. Results are drawn from the comparison across a holographic display, virtual reality glasses, a video conferencing tool, and a tele-presence robot. The paper concludes with takeaways for the future steps of the study.",

        "description": "Background Providing feedback in massive open online courses (MOOCs) is challenging due to the massiveness and heterogeneity of learners' population. Learning analytics (LA) solutions aim at scaling up feedback interventions and supporting instructors in this endeavour. Paper Objectives This paper focuses on instructor-led feedback mediated by LA tools in MOOCs. Our goal is to answer how, to what extent data-driven feedback is provided to learners, and what its impact is. Methods We conducted a systematic literature review on the state-of-the-art LA-informed instructor-led feedback in MOOCs. From a pool of 227 publications, we selected 38 articles that address the topic of LA-informed feedback in MOOCs mediated by instructors. We applied etic content analysis to the collected data. Results and Conclusions The results revealed a lack of empirical studies exploring LA to deliver feedback, and limited attention on pedagogy to inform feedback practices. Our findings suggest the need for systematization and evaluation of feedback. Additionally, there is a need for conceptual tools to guide instructors' in the design of LA-based feedback. Takeaways We point out the need for systematization and evaluation of feedback. We envision that this research can support the design of LA-based feedback, thus contributing to bridge the gap between pedagogy and data-driven practice in MOOCs.",

        "description": "Starting as niche programming events, hackathons have since become a popular form of collaboration. Events are organized in various domains across the globe, aiming to foster innovation and learning, create and expand communities and tackle civic and environmental issues. While research around such events has grown in recent years, most studies are based on observations of a few individuals during an event and on post-hoc interviews during which participants report their experiences. Such studies are helpful but somewhat limited in that they do not allow us to study how individuals communicate at scale using technology. To address this gap, we conducted an archival analysis of communication traces of teams during a 48-h event. Our findings indicate that teams scaffold their communication around the design of an event, influenced by milestones set by the organizers. The officially selected communication platform's main use was to organize the event and the teams and to facilitate contact between participants and hackathon officials. We further investigated the balance of intra-team communication on the given platform and the potential use of additional communication tools.",

        "description": "In this paper, we explored the impact of course design elements that aim to support and sustain students' engagement during a 12-week online course. The course we analyzed targeted higher education, master-level students of Computer Science and Educational Technologies, and took place fully online during the COVID-19 pandemic. The course was facilitated by a Learning Management System (LMS), and due to the circumstances, the instructor's primary goal was to motivate students to actively participate during the course's duration. To that end, the instructor implemented a course design focused on integrating elements such as interactive activities, short quizzes, hidden \"easter eggs,\" and real-time webinars. To study the impact of these elements on students' activity, we carried out an exploratory analysis of students' activity as recorded by the log files of the LMS and the qualitative feedback that students provided to the instructor. Our results suggest that the course's design supported sustaining students' engagement. The level of students' activity varied for the learning materials and resources, but we confirmed a high usage of the quizzes over the course's duration.",

        "description": "Multimodal Learning Analytics researchers have explored relationships between collaboration quality and multimodal data. However, the current state-of-art research works have scarcely investigated authentic settings and seldom used video data that can offer rich behavioral information. In this paper, we present our findings on potential indicators for collaboration quality and its underlying dimensions such as argumentation, and mutual understanding. We collected multimodal data (namely, video and logs) from 4 Estonian classrooms during authentic computer-supported collaborative learning activities. Our results show that vertical head movement (looking up and down) and mouth region features could be used as potential indicators for collaboration quality and its aforementioned dimensions. Also, our results from clustering provide indications of the potential of video data for identifying different levels of collaboration quality (e.g., high, low, medium). The findings have implications for building collaboration quality monitoring and guiding systems for authentic classroom settings.",

        "description": "By using standardised approaches, systematic reviews of the educational, scientific literature can inform educational research and influence educational policies and practices. However, the various systematic reviews of the scientific literature in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and education all adopt individual approaches, making it challenging to systematically compare their conclusions. Accordingly, this paper presents a standardised protocol for conducting systematic reviews of the scientific literature on AI and education (AI&ED), including both literature on teaching and learning with AI (AIED) and literature on teaching and learning about AI (AI literacy). Our protocol applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and is presented here for the purpose of replication and validation. We exemplify our protocol by means of a systematic review of the scientific literature on trustworthy and ethical AI&ED, which was undertaken iteratively in symbiosis with the development of the protocol, informing each other throughout. In the future, we intend to apply our novel protocol for other search terms of relevance to AI&ED, as well as for the same search terms over a longer time period, in order to allow comparisons and the exploration of trends.",
