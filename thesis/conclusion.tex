\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

I'm not sure what to put here but some things that come to mind are the final feedback from you as the stakeholder, as well as the limitations.

\section{Limitations}

For one, i'd like to go over the risk assessment plan in general and outlined how some risks were mitigated from the beginning, and how others were mitigated while/after they were encountered.

Then, how and why the actual implementation differed rather greatly from what was proposed/planned in the methodology section.

Later on i'd like to go over why certain features were dropped, though this strongly ties in with the "feature creep" part of the risk assessment plan so i might put it there.

I'll probably find some other things when i go through my notes and materials in detail. This is just a rough sketch that awaits your input :)

\section{Future Works}

Talking about what could be improved or added to this project after me.
For example implementing the features that didn't make it to the final version, optimizing certain processes or workflows, etc.
